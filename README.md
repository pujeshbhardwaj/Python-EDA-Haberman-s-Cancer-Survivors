## üåü Understanding Breast Cancer Survival: Exploratory Data Analysis üåü

**Introduction:**
Welcome to my GitHub project on Breast Cancer Survival analysis using Haberman's Cancer Survival dataset. This dataset contains invaluable information from a study conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the prestigious University of Chicago's Billings Hospital. The study focused on understanding the survival rates of patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer. The dataset provides crucial attributes such as age, year of operation, number of positive axillary nodes detected, and the patient's survival status (whether they survived beyond 5 years or not).

**Goal:**
Our primary objective is to explore the dataset and uncover patterns that could shed light on the survival rates of breast cancer patients. Through our analysis, we aim to gain deeper insights, which can guide us in selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm to predict patient survival rates after surgery.

**Key Questions and Findings:**

Age vs. Survival Status:
We investigated the relationship between the patient's age and their survival status. Surprisingly, younger patients (aged 40 and below) had a significantly higher success rate of 90%, compared to older patients, who exhibited a 71% success rate.

Positive Axillary Nodes vs. Survival Status:
Analyzing the number of positive axillary nodes and its effect on survival status, we found that younger patients showed higher survival rates across all node stages (N0-N3). Additionally, younger patients had a better chance of surviving beyond 5 years post-operation, regardless of the node stage.

Impact of Operation on Survival Status:
The operation's effectiveness varied based on the patient's age. Younger patients had a greater likelihood of successful outcomes after surgery, while older patients were more affected by the number of positive axillary nodes, particularly in stage N3 cancer, where the risk of mortality was higher.

Trends in Operations Over the Years:
Our analysis revealed fascinating trends in the number of operations performed over time. From 1958 to 1967, the number of operations remained relatively stable. However, in 1968 and 1969, there was a sharp decrease of approximately 50%. The impact of early breast cancer awareness on the need for surgery remains inconclusive and warrants further investigation.

Predicting Survival Status:
Based on our findings, predicting a patient's survival status effectively appears to be feasible. However, we must leverage appropriate machine learning algorithms and employ cross-validation techniques to ensure robust predictions.

**Conclusion:**
Breast cancer survival rates are influenced by various factors, such as age, positive axillary nodes, and the effectiveness of surgery. Younger patients tend to have higher survival rates, irrespective of node stage, while the number of positive nodes is a crucial factor affecting older patients' prognosis. Through this analysis, we aim to contribute to the fight against breast cancer by providing valuable insights that can aid medical practitioners in making informed decisions about patient care and treatment strategies.

Feel free to explore the code and analysis in this repository, and let's join hands in making a positive impact in the fight against breast cancer! Together, we can advance our understanding of this disease and improve patient outcomes. üéóÔ∏èüí™
